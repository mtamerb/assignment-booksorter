# Assignment - Book Sorter
## Book Sorter

1. Design a class called Book. 
2. Inherit from this class Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method.
3. Inside this method, write the code that sorts the book by name from A to Z. 
4. Create 4 objects of this class and store the objects in a Set type structure. 
5. Then use a Set type data structure a second time and have it sort the books by page count.

- The Book class consists of the name of the book, the number of pages, the name of the author, and the date of publication.
